# article_scraper
This project contains spiders to crawl and scrape info from couple of news websites namely cnn.com, apnews.com, news.yahoo.com.
This also contains a spider for wikipedia
You can find the spiders in the article_scraper/article_scraper/spiders/ location.

Currently the date scraped is put in json format into specific json files. The schema can be found out at article_scraper/article_scraper/items.py file.
The plan is to add database support to put the info during scraping to a database directly.
