Friends and fellow swimmers knew him as easygoing and likable. Now they were mystified. Why had someone who spent much of his life representing his country joined the mob to attack a defining symbol of American democracy?", "“That's what has made this so confusing, so frustrating for so many people,\" said", ", the 10-time Olympic swimming medalist who has known Keller for more than two decades. \"It seems so far outside of his character, his personality to get wrapped up in this.\"", "Keller, 39, has", "of obstructing an official proceeding before Congress and agreed to cooperate with the", ".", "The prominent role played by far-right groups like the Three Percenters, Proud Boys and Oath Keepers in the attack has captured much of the public’s attention. But", ", like Keller, weren’t members of extremist organizations. They held middle-class jobs. Their average age was 39, according to", ". The vast majority — 87% — were men. They came from 45 states and the District of Columbia. They carried a deep sense of grievance.", "Hundreds of pages of court records, emails and interviews with more than 30 friends, teammates and associates show that Keller’s journey to the Capitol was the latest and most bewildering choice in a life beset by struggles since retiring from swimming more than a decade ago. A revolving series of jobs. Divorce. Living in his car for 10 months.", ". Allegations of erratic behavior.", "His ex-wife testified in a child custody trial in October 2020 that he had attempted suicide and, after they separated, pinned her against a wall and asked whether she had \"ever heard of marital rape.\" Keller denied the allegation in a court filing. He described himself during the trial as “overwhelmed\" and \"lost\" in the years after his career ended. The belonging and identity he found while swimming eluded him on dry land.", "In a statement, Keller's criminal defense attorney, Edward B. MacMahon Jr., denied the allegations by Keller's ex-wife as \"one-sided and self-serving pleadings and statements.\" He noted that Keller is allowed to have unsupervised visits with his children and said he “is doing everything he can to be part of their life.\"", "\"Mr. Keller has admitted that he made a huge mistake by entering the Capitol,” the attorney said. \"He has accepted full responsibility for his actions that day and continues to work to rebuild his life and make amends for that error in judgment.\"", "Keller didn't respond to requests for comment and hasn't spoken publicly about the attack.", "In recent years, he settled in Colorado Springs, Colo., dived into a real estate career and got engaged. Some friends noticed a growing politicization and an unusually aggressive tone on social media in the months before last Jan. 6.", "\"He definitely fell in with the wrong crowd, but I would use that more if my teenager started making bad choices,\" said Daniel Soteres, a doctor who befriended Keller. \"There's something darker about what happened with Klete.\"", "In summer 2000, Keller had just graduated from high school when he twice broke the American record in the 400-meter freestyle that had stood for 12 years and won a bronze medal in the event at the Sydney Olympics, plus a relay silver.", "The 18-year-old's quirks outside the pool attracted attention too. The Times called him a \"space cadet\" because of his penchant for landing in odd situations — like tumbling into the SeaWorld walrus pit as a child and getting locked inside a zoo after hours.", "At USC, Keller captured three individual NCAA titles, then dropped out in 2002, later citing workouts that weren’t his style and sleeping through classes. He signed an endorsement contract with Speedo and moved to Ann Arbor, Mich., to train under legendary University of Michigan coach Jon Urbanchek at Club Wolverine. Young phenom Michael Phelps soon joined the group.", "In a sport built around grinding out tens of thousands of yards in the pool each week, Keller's happy-go-lucky approach stood out. Urbanchek called him “God’s gift to swimming.\" Dan Ketchum, who swam and shared a house with Keller, remembered a flawless stroke.", "Outside the pool, he lazed away hours watching television programs like “The O’Reilly Factor.” He quipped in an interview at the time that his “life’s passion” was “just sitting and observing.” Urbanchek rang Ketchum several times each week to locate Keller or remind him about a practice time (he was often late) or make sure he didn’t forget something (he misplaced fundamentals like swimsuits or his passport).", "Keller drove an old police car, shoveled horse manure at Urbanchek’s barn and shot trap and skeet. He gave big hugs and knew how to make people laugh.", "No one who encountered Keller in those years recalled politics playing a pivotal role in his life. Some said he leaned right, but that was it. Swimming overwhelmed everything. But there were hints of trouble.", "Urbanchek, who became a father figure to the young swimmer, said Keller had a strained relationship with his family. The coach recalled dining with Keller and his parents, Kelly and Karen, at their Phoenix home in December 1999 when Urbanchek pitched Keller on swimming for Michigan. The coach was staggered, he said, when “the mother pulls me over to the side and said, ‘Jon, don't waste your money. He's never going to make it through college.’”", "Keller joined USC instead, but regularly mentioned family struggles to friends and teammates. Tom Malchow, the former world record holder in the 200-meter butterfly who swam with Keller at Club Wolverine, said, \"I think he always felt like ... whatever he did was not good enough for them.\"", "In a series of messages to The Times, Kelly Keller said, “We as parents have been the villains in Klete’s life for years and that is why we have remained out of his life.” The father denied his son had a difficult childhood and said he and his wife gave their three children “nothing but support and love all of their lives.”", "Klete Keller’s sister Kelsey swam for the University of Washington, and his younger sister, Kalyn, competed for USC and represented the U.S. at the Athens Olympics in 2004.", "“We support Klete going to the Capitol and showing his passion and patriotism for our wonderful country,” Kelly Keller continued. “He did not damage anything or hurt anyone there. They have made him the FACE of the Capitol Event because of who he is.”", "Malchow recalled other problems before the Athens Olympics. Klete Keller suffered from insomnia, Malchow said. There were times he didn’t attend practice or, if he showed up, Malchow said, \"I don't want to use the word volatile, but he was definitely not the happy-go-lucky kind of team clown. ... It was a different side of him than we were used to seeing.\"", "That wasn't in evidence in Athens, where Keller faced a daunting challenge in the 800-meter freestyle relay. Australia hadn't lost the race in seven years, and Ian Thorpe anchored the team. The superstar owned the world record in the 200 freestyle.", "Phelps, Ryan Lochte and Peter Vanderkaay swam the first three legs for the U.S. to give Keller a 1.5-second lead in the final 200 meters.", "Thorpe quickly pulled even with Keller. The American didn't falter. He matched Thorpe stroke for stroke and touched the wall an instant ahead to", ".", "Afterward, Phelps called the race “one of the greatest in history,” while Keller said it felt “like you’re in another world, it’s an out-of-body experience.” He joined his teammates on the podium in Team USA jackets.", "But difficulties continued away from the pool.", "Cari Sherrill, Keller's ex-wife, recalled an episode when he tried to exit her car while they were driving on a freeway. He believed taxis were chasing them. She said Keller visited hospital emergency rooms twice while they were dating, including after the freeway incident, for mental health reasons.", "When Sherrill raised her worries about her boyfriend's behavior with coaches, she said, they blamed the stress of being a professional athlete.", "In early 2007, Keller returned to USC to train with the Trojan Swim Club and finish his degree in public policy and real estate development. He won another gold medal in the 800-meter freestyle relay at the Beijing Olympics the following year.", "He married Sherrill a month later — Urbanchek was one of the groomsmen — and started life in the real world.", "Two years later, on Halloween in 2010, Sherrill took the couple’s daughter, then 10 months old, to urgent care to get stitches on her chin. Pregnant with twin boys, Sherrill learned during the visit that the family no longer had health insurance.", "“I found out that Klete actually didn’t have a job,” she told the court during the child custody trial. “He had been lying to me and driving around\" as if going to work.", "About a month after learning they didn't have insurance, Sherrill testified, Keller told her he attempted suicide, though she added he now denies it happened.", "“He came home with his face purple in color and he was crying,” Sherrill told the court. “He showed me the funnel and the tube he had bought from the store to hook to his car exhaust. Then he [had] hooked it up and sat there for a few minutes with it on, then the noise of the car scared him and he turned it off. He came home and told me that story and that he really needed help.”", "Keller had taken out a life insurance policy that he said covered suicide, Sherrill testified, and told her “that was his last resort because … he couldn’t keep a job.”", "Though athletes often struggle for direction after their competition days end, Keller said in", "that he hadn't been worried about his transition.", "“All those years of success I had with swimming really gave me an inaccurate expectation of the world. It was much harder to cope with the little mini-failures I would experience on any given day,” he said. “I wasn’t a good employee or worker for the longest time because I expected it all to come to me as easily as swimming did.", "“I had talked to my mentors and they had said, ‘Listen, you’re going to have no problem going in and immediately making six figures right out of the gate. Everybody’s going to want to hire you.’ … When those things didn’t happen, it really affected my outlook.”", "He described himself as having been \"a real lazy, spoiled, entitled person.”", "When Keller took the stand during the custody trial, he said he had to \"basically figure out who I was\" after swimming and didn’t have anyone with whom he could discuss his “concerns or fears” about living in the real world.", "“It was very overwhelming to have three kids in diapers and also needing to support them,\" Keller testified, \"and that kind of led to some confusion on my part. I was lost.”", "During the custody trial, Sherrill estimated that Keller had held 15 to 17 jobs. His employers included a securities firm that touted his Olympic medals in an advertisement and a national financial services company. Keller said in the podcast he was fired from the latter job the day after the couple legally separated on Jan. 28, 2014. He didn't give the reason.", "The churn of jobs continued in the following years: a swim school, construction company, ride-sharing service, an account executive with a national real estate company and swim clinics.", "“He was not able to adjust from having everyone cater to him and do things for him to having to do them for himself,” Sherrill said.", "She told The Times that Keller spent much of their relationship blaming his parents for problems during his upbringing. The parents have never met his three children, according to court records. Eventually, she said, his resentment focused on her.", "In an email Sherrill sent Keller five days after their separation that was entered as an exhibit in the custody case, she wrote: “You have to get help. Did you know your work called me to discuss your mental status and your dad and your grandma? Hello? ... Blaming me isn’t going to help you see the kids. Getting help will.”", "Keller responded: “What’s not fair is you keeping them from me and not allowing me to see them or even talk to them. They’re not bargaining chips, they’re children.”", "Sherrill testified Keller entered her home late one night shortly after the separation.", "“He was standing behind me in my bathroom. It scared me fairly bad,” she testified. “I ended up talking him to the top of my stairway because he wouldn’t leave. … He pinned me up against my sons' bedroom door and said, ‘Have you ever heard of marital rape?’ It caused something of a physical shoving match and then I threatened to call the police, so he left.”", "Keller wasn’t questioned about the accusation during the trial.", "Neighbors alerted Sherrill several times when they spotted Keller outside her home. In court filings, Sherrill accused him of stalking her. At the trial, Keller’s attorney asked whether she had summoned police.", "“No,” Sherrill testified. “I slept with a gun in my bed instead.”", "Following the separation, Keller’s life turned nomadic. He lived with his sister Kalyn and her husband in Maryland for six or seven months, then relocated to Southern California at his grandmother’s home in Running Springs. He appeared with other Olympians at a handful of swim clinics across the country, but didn’t have a full-time job. After clinics, participants posed for pictures with Keller and his gold medal from Beijing.", "In an", "in spring 2014, Keller sounded conflicted about his years of swimming: “I should have put a lot more time into thinking about careers and what I was doing after swimming. … I still probably hold some bitterness toward myself mostly, but also a little bit toward my sport because I let myself get too deep into it. I’m still not quite over that, unfortunately, but I’m working on it.”", "Sherrill sued Keller for child support in Mecklenburg County District Court in North Carolina and, that September, Judge Christy T. Mann ordered him to pay $191 a month and get a full-time job. The judge wrote: “Defendant’s underemployment is voluntary and is a result of Defendant’s naive indifference to his children’s immediate financial needs.”", "Keller moved to North Carolina that October and testified later that he lived in his Ford Fusion because the child support obligation made it impossible to pay the first and last months’ rent for an apartment. He slept in Walmart parking lots and maintained a gym membership to shower.", "The following month, according to court records, Keller told the judge that he was “mentally and physically incapable of working\" and struggled with depression.", "Acting as his own attorney, Keller filed two court actions alleging Sherrill refused to allow contact and visitation with the children. Both were dismissed for procedural defects. The children called him “Uncle Klete” or “Mr. Klete.”", "“I’m not going away and you’re not going to push me out of their lives,” Keller wrote in an email to Sherrill in mid-2015.", "Sherrill, who had remarried, listed concerns about her ex-husband in an email later that year to a therapist who worked with the family: “Emotional stability. Crying, yelling, being sarcastic, calling kids names, saying inappropriate things to kids, at kids or about me. ... Bizarre and unpredictable behavior towards me, at me or in the presence of me at every interaction within the last two years.”", "When Keller returned to court in late 2016 for a child support trial,", ". Mann wrote that, once again, swim clinics were Keller’s only employment. She said she hoped he would “grow up,” but he had “failed to rise to the occasion\" and was \"old enough to know better.\" He was 34.", "A year later, in fall 2017, Keller abruptly moved to Colorado Springs without a job. When he later explained the reason for relocating, he cited frustration with the custody situation — he had sued Sherrill for joint custody — and a long-standing affinity for the area from his days at the Olympic training center in the city.", "Keller got his real estate license, spent nine months at a residential real estate firm, then moved to another. Colleagues recalled a quiet, personable co-worker with an easy smile who enjoyed mountain biking and hiking and didn’t hide his post-swimming difficulties. Conversations often turned to his children.", "He posted glowing Facebook messages about life in Colorado. USA Swimming published an upbeat story about him. On the surface, he appeared to have turned a corner.", "Though Keller registered as a Libertarian in North Carolina, he didn't affiliate with a party when registering to vote in Colorado in late 2017. He didn't usually talk politics. As the pandemic intensified in 2020, friends noticed his social media posts opposed public health interventions such as masks and supported Trump. Some said his online presence seemed aggressive and at odds with the low-key person who raised chickens in the yard of the house he shared with his girlfriend.", "Soteres, the Colorado Springs doctor, teamed with Keller on two relays at a masters swim meet in March 2020. He said Keller's affable, laid-back personality made him easy to get along with. But Soteres noticed he was bothered by pandemic-related restrictions and believed his friend entered a \"social media wormhole\" and perhaps felt \"the system alienated him, maybe stole his children from him.\"", "\"I think that he got to a darker and darker place within that sort of vacuum,\" Soteres said.", "He recalled offering a counterpoint to one of Keller’s posts. Keller, he said, responded with a direct message threatening to block his friend if he posted another response.", "Several friends remembered another post by Keller — one person called it a diatribe, another a rant — describing a run-in at a supermarket where he alleged a person confronted him for not wearing a mask or walking the wrong way down a one-way aisle and followed him home.", "Keller missed a scheduled weekend visit with his twin boys in North Carolina in March, according to court records. The judge in the custody case wrote: \"He blamed it on the weather but told the kids he had to work. His flight was not cancelled.\" Sherrill alleged in court filings and testimony that Keller had missed or been late for several visits.", "When Keller learned the twins had started meeting with therapists, he fired off an email to Sherrill: “What a joke.” He expressed alarm that one of them might be put on medication \"for any disorder these quacks might think he has.\" No medication had been suggested, Sherrill testified.", "Early that August, according to court records, Keller took his 9-year-old twins through the Virginia Creeper Trail in southwestern Virginia and “allowed the boys to shoot at road signs with a BB gun from the window of a moving vehicle.” Questioned about the episode during the custody trial, Keller said, “There was no one on the road and I thought it would be a fun thing to do.”", "Later that month, Keller attended a fundraiser for then-U.S. Sen. Cory Gardner (R-Colo.) at the Colorado Springs home of Eli Bremer, who competed in the modern pentathlon in the Beijing Olympics. Bremer once suggested Keller run for office; he thought maybe he could be a county commissioner. Active in Republican politics in Colorado, Bremer didn't see a well-developed set of political views in Keller and described his approach as \"very passive.\"", "\"If you said what's one issue that could really light him on fire, it would be his kids,\" Bremer said.", "When Keller testified at the child custody trial, his tone was different than in the 2018 podcast where he sounded remorseful for post-swimming choices and described himself as having become “a whiny baby.” He recast himself as a victim of his ex-wife, described past problems as “bumps in the road” and wished he would’ve gone to court sooner to seek “my rights as a father.” He compared not being able to see his children to being imprisoned.", "“Anything good about me has been stripped away and a narrative has been spun that paints me in an extremely bad light and kind of puts fear in their hearts a little bit toward me until we get together and spend time together and it melts away,” Keller testified.", "Two weeks later, Iredell County Judge Christine Underwood awarded sole legal custody of the twins to Sherrill along with temporary sole legal custody of their then-10-year-old daughter. In her order, the judge wrote that Keller “steadfastly denies he has any mental health conditions despite years of housing and employment instability, and despite a previous suicide attempt.”", "He was \"the epitome of a 'fun' dad,\" she added, but also \"very much acts like a kid himself.\" She found that Sherrill had been an “excellent mother\" and that Keller is a \"fit and proper person to have visitation and contact with the minor children, given certain parameters.\"", "In mid-November 2020, Keller flew to Washington with his girlfriend for the “Million MAGA March” protesting the presidential election outcome. Wire service photos captured him waving a Colorado flag amid thousands of pro-Trump protesters.", "“I think he felt like because he couldn't be involved in his kids’ life on a daily basis that maybe he could have a positive impact for his kids by having a cause and really being faithful to that cause,” said Holly Trinidad, managing broker at Hoff & Leigh, the commercial real estate firm in Colorado Springs that Keller joined in summer 2020. “Probably the underlying psychology behind that was doing something to better the future for his kids, which really comes from a place of love.”", "On Dec. 18, 2020, the Iredell County Sheriff’s Office responded to a call at 7:26 p.m. for “custody issues” at Sherrill’s home in Davidson, N.C. A court filing by Sherrill’s attorney described Keller arriving for a scheduled visit with the twins and becoming furious when one of the boys resisted leaving.", "“[Keller] angrily said numerous ugly, demeaning, and threatening things to [Sherrill] and her husband,” the filing said.", "It alleged that Keller “continued his verbal attacks on [Sherrill] and her family throughout the weekend, and when [the twins] defended [Sherrill] and her family, [Keller] became enraged and told [the twins] that he might not come visit them anymore, and it was their fault.”", "Sixteen days after the visit, Keller flew to Washington.", "Wearing the Team USA jacket issued to U.S. Olympians at the", "in 2018 — it's unclear how Keller acquired it — he listened near the Washington Monument on Jan. 6 as Trump addressed tens of thousands of supporters.", "Shortly after 2 p.m., as Congress met to", "as president, numerous photos and videos captured Keller among the mob pressing toward police in front of scaffolding erected for Inauguration Day on the west side of the Capitol. Keller quickly worked his way within a few feet of the front line as police tried to hold back the mass of people with pepper spray, metal barricades and tear gas grenades. A photo showed Keller extending both middle fingers.", "At 2:39 p.m., surveillance video captured Keller holding his phone as he strode into the Capitol through the Upper West Terrace doors. In his statement of offense, Keller acknowledged, “I know that I did not have permission to enter the building” and “I believed that I and others were trying to obstruct, influence, and impede” Congress certifying the election.", "Keller passed through the Rotunda and joined the confrontation between rioters and police in the long hallway leading to the Senate chamber. Police drove back the mob with streams of pepper spray.", "Eleven minutes after Keller returned to the Rotunda, police started clearing the packed room. Amid a scene that resembled a mosh pit, Keller jerked his elbow to shake off officers, according to his", ".", "After being shoved out of the Rotunda, Keller lingered near the statues of War and Peace. He clapped his hands, took photos of police trying to eject the mob, and appeared to laugh in surveillance video footage as rioters surged into the room through the east Rotunda doors. At 3:27 p.m., Keller was driven out of the Capitol, still holding his phone in the air.", "During the next 24 hours, according to", ", Keller destroyed his phone and memory card. Deleted social media accounts. Threw away the Team USA jacket.", "Five days after the attack, a swimming website, SwimSwam,", "linking Keller to the riot.

He’s a strong American. … Klete was about as American as anybody can be. Maybe he was too American.”", "A grand jury indicted Keller on seven counts. Citing the Capitol attack and the December incident in North Carolina, Sherrill filed a motion to reduce his visits with the twins.", "In May, according to Colorado real estate licensing records, Keller resumed working for Hoff & Leigh.", "“He was completely remorseful,\" Trinidad said of Keller in the days and weeks after the attack. \"He was like, ‘I should have never gone. Had I known what this was going to turn out to be, I would never have gone and never have done this.’ … He's genuinely a good-hearted person and you can’t have enough people in your life that are truly good-hearted people, regardless of how you feel about their politics.”", "Urbanchek said during an interview in June that Keller was apologetic, wanted to turn his life around and remained “very confident” he’d get out of the charges with a fine.", "But many of those who know Keller remain puzzled by his involvement.", "“He was struggling with identity and hard times,” said Hall, the Olympic medalist. “That’s what these radicals prey upon. He got swept up in it.”", "Soteres put it bluntly: “This is a guy who has been given more second chances than most people get first chances.”", "As part of a deal with prosecutors, Keller pleaded guilty Sept. 29 to a felony count of obstructing Congress. He won’t be sentenced until his cooperation with the government is finished. But he faces much more than a fine. Sentencing guidelines call for 21 to 27 months in federal prison.", "The twins are \"completely resistant to any form of contact\" with Keller in the aftermath of the Capitol attack, according to a motion filed by Sherrill's attorney in the custody case in late 2021, and he hadn't visited them in almost a year.", "On Oct. 28, Keller joined hundreds of commercial real estate agents attending a charity boxing event in Arvada, Colo. He wore a suit, clutched a drink and grinned as he posed for a picture with two colleagues amid the celebration.", "Keller’s biography returned to Hoff & Leigh’s website the same week.

They're now large-capacity conference rooms, where teachers can come for their learning needs.", "\"The district has needed its own dedicated space for this,\" said Ketta Garduno, associate superintendent for curriculum and instruction. \"In the past, we'd ended up farming out to other buildings in the district. This gives us our own dedicated space.\"", "That's only a portion of the old school facility, though. There's another piece to the puzzle that is Hartford Center. And it's a public-facing one with implications for thousands of school children and their families.", "Darrin Cox was running out of room in the basement of One AISD Center.", "There, Cox maintained an elaborate storage room filled with any number of supplies for children. Clothing racks filled with sweatshirts and pants filled a room lined with shelves of sneakers and other shoes. All items in any size that a student at the district could need.", "There were also other supplies, such as notebooks, pens and pencils, scissors and glue. And backpacks to put them in.", "Those materials aren't available for just any student, though. Cox is in charge of the district's response to homeless students, as classified under the federal McKinney-Vento Act. There's a process by which students and families qualify for Cox's assistance.", "What started a few years ago in a tiny closet next to his office in the federal programs division of the district's administration building has outgrown two large rooms in the underground area of the former downtown shopping mall.", "Taking over what was originally the administrative offices of the former Reagan Elementary, along with a few of the classrooms closest to Hartford Street, Cox now has more room to spread out and improve the experience for those coming to either request his services or repeat.", "\"Here what's nice about this new space: one of classrooms can be almost a welcome center for those coming in,\" Cox said. \"We have some booklets available. It's ... very welcoming. Our families who've used it already stress to me how welcoming it is.\"", "In addition to the welcome space, Cox said his new location offers three main rooms filled to the brim with supplies.", "The first, he said, will focus primarily on the middle school experience. With those schools requiring standardized dress, every piece of the uniform is available in many different sizes. Both for boys and girls.", "This room also will have physical education clothing, so that students requiring his services won't be without more athletic options during gym classes. Hygiene packs, including toothbrushes and toothpaste, along with underwear and socks — the two most requested items in his entire store — round out the room's contents.", "In room No. 2, other clothing items are available. From jeans and slacks — part of Cox's mission is to make sure his older students have clothing that can help them secure jobs — to all kinds of shirts, there's plenty of clothing options available, Cox said.", "Options are even available for infants, he said, both for children of homeless students and for families who have newly born siblings.", "And the last room?", "That's for the feet, he said.", "\"The last room is the shoe room,\" Cox said. \"And they're all new shoes ... 99.9% of them are new shoes.\"", "Last year, Cox said, his office helped about 1,400 students. So far this year, the number is about 820. So the extra space is pretty handy.", "The shoe room will split space with the array of jackets and coats, though, as those items didn't fit in the other rooms.", "One final room, not accessible to the public, is the new storage space, Cox said. Offering a place to hold items that are essentially excess until the products out on display can be moved out to students, it's massive.", "\"It's as big as our entire storage area I had, plus half of the show room, at (One AISD Center),\" Cox said.", "Garduno, meanwhile, has the end of February circled on her calendar.", "That is when the building's other use will get its first huge test.", "Though the professional learning programs such as", "'s teacher training programs have been operating out of the space since it reopened in the fall, there haven't been district-wide events.", "Come Feb. 23, Garduno will know whether the plan works.", "\"One of the challenges is parking,\" Garduno said. 'We're having to look at how can we economically meet our parking needs. There are only 100 spots right now. We need a lot more than that. Maybe we'll use Clack's parking lot. But we're thinking outside the box to try to solve these problems and make sure we're fully utilizing our facility.\"", "A facility like this one, aimed at providing teachers with a dedicated space for their own learning and professional development is an important piece in Garduno's arsenal, she said.", "It gives coaches a place to call their own with dedicated space for their materials. But it also offers a clear path to getting back to helping teachers become their best professional selves.", "Garduno said that was one of the best parts of being a campus principal once she left the classroom behind and entered administration.", "\"When I was a campus principal, one of the things I enjoyed the most was working with teachers, including younger teachers who were just out of school,\" Garduno said. \"I have missed that day-to-day interaction with those teachers.", "\"I believe we need to prepare our teachers with the tools they need and by investing in them, we are going to be able to prepare our teachers well. Our local universities do fantastic jobs, but the field of education is constantly changing. It's our responsibility to help the teachers with what they need. This facility gives us the opportunity to support those teachers.\"", "One of the biggest pieces, evolving the most, is technology.", "The staff at the center will be well equipped both with the latest products such as applications, and the hardware needed to run them, Garduno said.", "The center has a dedicated computer lab, along with 16 rooms for professional learning. Hartford Center also has four mock classrooms, where the district's educators can practice what they've seen before taking it to their classrooms.", "Gym and cafeteria spaces are also available with 180 seats each, as well, for the big gatherings.", "Because the majority of space on the ground floor of One AISD Center is taken up with offices, there were few options in the building for extra things.", "Like Cox's homeless students operation or trainings like new teacher orientation in August.", "\"(We're) not downstairs where it's dark,\" Cox said.", "\"We've done a lot of work using our people,\" Garduno added. \"We've put in a lot of work making sure (Hartford Center) is inviting, that it's clean.\"", "Cox's roughly 25 volunteers who help him maintain the stock and appearance of his operation probably appreciate not having to be downstairs, practically by themselves, he said.", "It'll likely make all the difference in the world to anyone, even the folks using the service, he said.", "\"We have a small group of little old ladies who've been helping for the last two years,\" he said. \"I really think the tide of this community is going to be strengthened with us (at Hartford Center)."], "url": "https://news.yahoo.com/abilene-isds-hartford-center-now-205802861.html", "site": "yahoo"},

The wall next to his bunk was covered in other peoples’ snot and slime, he says. “It was filthy.” There were always plumbing issues and the smell of sewage was constant, he says. And then there was the violence. He alleges that after he cursed at a corrections officer for refusing to turn on his water to flush his toilet, the officer beat him, handcuffed him and pepper sprayed him twice. He says he reported the incident, but the officer remained on staff.", "“I thought I was going to die,” says Cohen, who now advocates for criminal justice reform in D.C. and the surrounding area. “The pepper spray stayed in my hair for months. Every time I took a shower it would trickle down my body and it was like I was being burned by acid.”", "For years, advocates have raised concerns to the District of Columbia government over what they say are inhumane conditions inside the CDF, a nearly 50-year-old jail just two miles from the U.S. Capitol. Yet it was only when detainees accused of storming the Capitol building last Jan. 6 began raising complaints about the conditions of a neighboring jail facility that reform efforts gained momentum. After Jan. 6 defendants’ lawyers raised allegations of", "at the Department of Corrections (DOC) facility, including a lack of access to medical care, an unannounced review of the jail by the U.S. Marshals Service (USMS)", "there was “evidence of systemic failure.” USMS announced Nov. 2 that it would move 400 federal detainees out of the CDF to a federal prison in Pennsylvania.", "", "The D.C. government has promised to improve conditions at the CDF.

They’re not going to do anything unless white people say it’s a problem,” he says. “If the insurrectionists can be treated like humans, the people who’ve been in this city can be treated like humans.”", "Washington D.C.’s criminal justice system is—in a word—complicated. The District, which is not a state, once had its own prison system, but cut a deal with the federal government in 2000 when it fell into financial trouble. Today, the federal government handles functions normally left to a state, like imprisoning convicted felons, and D.C. government handles more local tasks, like running the jail that houses people charged with local and federal crimes, many of whom are awaiting trial.", "CDF, which opened in 1976, has faced allegations of overflowing sewage, dirty water, inadequate medical care, unhealthy food conditions and widespread violence stretching back decades, says Jonathan Smith, executive director of the Washington Lawyers’ Committee for Civil Rights and Urban Affairs and a member of the independent District Task Force on Jails & Justice, which the D.C. city council", "in 2019 to examine the future of the jail.", "“It’s just been a chronic problem, both in management and maintenance of that facility, since literally the day that it opened,” says Smith. “It’s been a failed and broken institution.”", "Reports have flagged these problems for", ".

A year after the attack, federal prosecutors have charged more than 725 people with crimes in connection with the attempted insurrection. Dozens of Jan. 6 defendants are now being held in the D.C. jail in the specialized, lower security Central Treatment Facility (CTF) across the street from CDF.", "Several of the so-called “Sixers,” as they’re known to their supporters, soon began raising concerns through their attorneys and families about the conditions of their confinement.

In May, Worrell, who had non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma, hurt his hand while in jail.

I don’t know if it’s because he is a Jan. 6 defendant or not, but I find that this matter should be referred to the attorney general of the United States … for a civil rights investigation.”", "", "Five days later, USMS began a surprise inspection of both CTF and CDF, prompted, it said, by “recent and historical concerns” that had been raised about the jail, including recent comments by judges.", "In a", "released Nov. 1, USMS said they’d found “evidence of systemic failure,” particularly in CDF. The memo’s findings about the CDF included water and food appearing to be punitively withheld from detainees; “large amounts of standing human sewage” in the toilets of multiple occupied cells causing “the smell of urine and feces” to overpower; detainees in certain areas not being able to drink water, wash hands or flush toilets because water had been shut off for days; that DOC staff “confirmed to inspectors” that the cells’ water is “routinely shut off” punitively; that food delivery and storage was “inconsistent with industry standards; evidence of “pervasive” drug use; that DOC staff were observed “antagonizing detainees;” that detainees had “observable injuries with no corresponding medical or incident reports available to inspectors,” and that “supervisors appeared unaware or uninterested in any of these issues.”", "The D.C. government disputes many of the allegations the USMS made about conditions at the jail, including that water has ever been denied to residents or shut off for days.", "The USMS memo concluded that while CTF, where the Jan. 6 defendants are being held, met the minimum federal standards of confinement, CDF did not. On Nov. 2, USMS", "it would remove all of the detainees in CDF under its custody—roughly 400 people in total—to a federal prison in Lewisburg, Pa.", "The USMS declined TIME’s request for an interview, but shared a Dec. 2 statement that said approximately 200 federal detainees had been transferred out of CDF, the majority to the Lewisburg prison as well as “other facilities in the region.” “Prisoners remaining in CDF have stayed in place for a variety of reasons, such as pending court-related matters, emergency stay orders granted by the court, and medical issues which prohibit transfer at this time, among others,” the statement said. USMS also said it was placing a “detention liaison” at CDF to monitor the facility.", "Russell Rowe, a 32-year-old Black D.C. resident, had been detained in CDF since July at the time of USMS’s surprise inspection. He says he saw the same “deplorable” conditions the report alleges, and witnessed widespread violence, the constant smell of sewage and issues with flooding. He says if there was a fight, blood could remain on the floor for hours after. “Everything [USMS] reported, inmates had reported for the past 30 years,” Rowe says.", "On Nov. 10, D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser and the USMS", "that they’d entered into a Memorandum of Understanding outlining how they would collaborate to improve conditions in CDF. But during a public roundtable that day, Deputy Mayor for Public Safety and Justice Chris Geldart said that while the D.C. executive realizes “there are some systemic issues that have persisted at DOC,” it does not believe they’re so pervasive that CDF is uninhabitable, and said the executive is against the transfer of detainees “over 200 miles away from their family support structure and attorneys.”", "During the Nov. 10 roundtable, Geldart listed steps the DOC was taking to improve the facility, including inspecting all toilets and plumbing outlets, identifying “operational deficiencies,” and reviewing service requests. He said that while DOC denies allegations about water shutoffs, they have inspected pipes in the mentioned areas and strengthened policies regarding who turns off the water, as well as started having their food vendor deliver extra drinks with meals. He said that DOC will continue to work with its vendor to ensure all meals are provided according to industry standards, and is running training during roll call on “effective communication and customer service skills” for staff. He added that DOC is increasing the number of random contraband searches on units with smoke, and that his office is working to increase the Corrections Information Council’s (CIC) access and monitoring of the jail.", "In all, Geldart said, the DOC fulfills around 200-250 work orders a month at the D.C. jail, over 80% of which are for clogged toilet pipes or sink drains. He acknowledged that the Department has faced staffing issues, which have been exacerbated by the long hours and tough work conditions amid the pandemic.", "Most advocates argue none of this goes far enough to fix the serious problems at the D.C. jail—and it comes too late. “It’s like a bandaid on a gunshot wound,” says Anthony Petty, who was detained in the jail in the 1990s and is now a member of the advocacy group Neighbors for Justice.", "Smith says the Task Force on Jails & Justice has received “no clarity into this reform effort,” and argues there’s “no meaningful oversight” of those efforts.", "Some advocates say USMS’ decision to move hundreds of detainees to Pennsylvania is a quick fix that didn’t solve anything. Rowe was among those moved to Pennsylvania, before being transferred back to D.C. just a week later because he’d been enrolled in a program in CTF. In his opinion, too, moving the detainees was a mistake. The conditions in Pennsylvania weren’t much better, he says, and people who had yet to be convicted of any crime were taken away from their families and legal counsel.", "Joel Castón, a commissioner on D.C.’s Advisory Neighborhood Commission 7F who was", "in June 2021 while still detained in the D.C. jail, agrees. “That was not a remedy,” Castón says. “If we felt that [CDF] was an inadequate space for [detainees], we should have allowed Washingtonians and our elected officials to come up with what we felt was our most viable option to fix that.”", "Ultimately, most people who have been following conditions at the D.C. jail agree that the best solution would be to tear down CDF altogether, and build a new jail. Geldart said as much in the Nov. 10 hearing, adding that the D.C. executive is committed to working to determine the right location and budget for the project.", "But building a new jail takes time. There were 937 detainees in CDF", "and it’s unclear where they would go while that was happening. “That’s the million dollar question,” Petty says. “I don’t want to see detainees taken away from their families.”", "In the meantime the jail continues to operate. Some detainees were complaining about sewage overspilling and flooding as recently as December, someone familiar with the inner-workings of the jail tells TIME, who spoke on the condition of anonymity.", "When Rowe returned to CDF on Nov. 18 after his brief transfer to Pennsylvania, he says “nothing had changed at all,” and remained the same until he was released in mid-December.", "As for Cohen, seeing reform efforts finally take shape years after his own experiences in detention has been infuriating.", "“They should have fixed these problems a long long time ago,” he says. “It’s a slap in the face.”"], "url": "https://news.yahoo.com/crisis-d-c-jail-began-120049848.html", "site": "yahoo"},

{"title": "Arbery killers get life in prison; no parole for father, son", "author": "Associated Press", "time": "January 8, 2022, 1:48 AM", "description": "In November, a jury convicted all three defendants of murder, aggravated assault, false imprisonment and attempted false imprisonment.", "content": ["BRUNSWICK, Ga. — Ahmaud Arbery's family asked a judge to show no lenience Friday in sentencing three white men convicted of", "for chasing the running", "in pickup trucks, cutting off his escape and fatally blasting him with a shotgun.", "During the sentencing hearing, Arbery's sister recalled her brother's humor, describing him as a positive thinker with a big personality. She told the judge her brother had dark skin “that glistened in the sunlight,\" thick, curly hair and an athletic build, factors that made him a target to the men who pursued him.", "“These are the qualities that made these men assume that Ahmaud was a dangerous criminal and chase them with guns drawn. To me, those qualities reflect a young man full of life and energy who looked like me and the people I loved,\" Jasmine Arbery said.", "Murder carries a mandatory sentence of life in prison under Georgia law unless prosecutors seek the death penalty, which they opted against for Arbery’s killing. For Superior Court Judge Timothy Walmsley, the main decision will be whether to grant father and son Greg and Travis McMichael and their neighbor, William “Roddie” Bryan, an eventual chance to earn parole.", "Arbery's mother asked for the maximum sentence, saying she suffered a personal, intense loss made worse by a trial where the men's defense was that Arbery made bad choices that led to his death.", "“This wasn’t a case of mistaken identity or mistaken fact. They chose to target my son because they didn’t want him in their community. They chose to treat him differently than other people who frequently visited their community,” Wanda Cooper-Jones said. \"And when they couldn’t sufficiently scare or intimidate him, they killed him.”", "Prosecutor Linda Dunikoski asked the judge for life without parole for Travis and Greg McMichael and the possibility of parole for Bryan. But she said all deserved that mandatory life sentence for showing “no empathy for the trapped and terrified Ahmaud Arbery.”", "Contending the McMichaels still believed they didn’t do anything wrong, Dunikoski disclosed Friday that Greg McMichael gave Bryan's cellphone video of the shooting to an attorney, who leaked it.", "“He believed it was going to exonerate him,” the prosecutor said.", "Whether the judge grants parole, either choice amounts to a stiff sentence. Even if the judge allows a possibility of parole, the McMichaels and Bryan will have to serve at least 30 years in prison first.", "For Travis McMichael, who is 35, the possibility for parole could mean hope for release from prison in his 60s, said Robert Rubin, one of his defense attorneys. He argued that Travis McMichael opened fire only after “Mr. Arbery came at him and grabbed the gun.” But Rubin also acknowledged his client's decisions to arm himself and chase Arbery were ”reckless\" and “thoughtless.”", "“They are not evidence of a soul so blackened as to deserve to spend the rest of his life in prison,\" Rubin said. “This was not a planned murder. This was a fight over a gun that led to Mr. Arbery’s death.”", "Greg McMichael recently turned 66, and Bryan is 52, raising the chances that they would spend the remainder of their lives in prison even if granted a chance of parole.", "Greg McMichael's lawyer, Laura Hogue, said her client has health problems and acknowledged he likely won't ever get out of prison. But he said granting him a chance at parole would show he didn't intend Arbery to die, never pulling his gun until his son fired his shotgun.", "“Greg McMichael did not leave his home that day hoping to kill,” Hogue told the judge. “He did not view his son firing that shotgun with anything other than fear and sadness. What this jury found was this was an unintentional act.”", "Bryan's lawyer said he should get a chance at parole because he showed remorse and cooperated with police, turning over the cellphone video of the shooting to help them get to the truth.", "“Mr. Bryan isn’t the one who brought a gun,” Kevin Gough said. “He was unarmed. And I think that reflects his intentions.”", "The guilty verdicts against the men handed down the day before Thanksgiving prompted a victory celebration outside the Glynn County courthouse for those who saw Arbery’s death as part of a larger national reckoning on racial injustice.", "All three men were also convicted of aggravated assault, false imprisonment and criminal attempt to commit false imprisonment. Maximum prison terms for those counts range from five to 20 years. The judge was likely to allow those additional penalties to be served simultaneously with the life sentences for murder.", "The McMichaels grabbed guns and jumped in a pickup truck to chase the 25-year-old Arbery after spotting him running in their neighborhood outside the Georgia port city of Brunswick on Feb. 23, 2020. Bryan joined the pursuit in his own truck and recorded cellphone video of Travis McMichael firing close-range shotgun blasts into Arbery as he threw punches and grabbed for the weapon.", "The killing went largely unnoticed until two months later, when the graphic video was leaked online and touched off a national outcry. The Georgia Bureau of Investigation took over the case from local police and soon arrested all three men.", "Defense attorneys have said they plan to appeal the convictions. They have 30 days after sentencing to file them.", "Next month, the McMichaels and Bryan face a second trial, this time in U.S. District Court on federal hate crime charges.
