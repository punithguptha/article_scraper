The officers move toward the man, who is out of the camera’s frame, and one fires a stun gun at him. Suddenly, the officers run off as the man reenters the frame, his head and body in flames.", "The disturbing footage was released publicly Friday by Attorney General Letitia James, who opened an investigation into the Oct. 30 confrontation after the man, Jason Jones, 29, of Catskill, New York, died last month.", "James said in a statement that her office’s investigation was continuing and that the footage was being “released to the public in order to increase transparency and strengthen public trust in these matters.”", "Kevin Luibrand, a lawyer for Jones’ family, said that he and his clients had reviewed the footage about two weeks ago and that it corroborated what they believe happened.", "“It just confirms it in the vividness that only such an incident can be captured,” he said.", "Jones, a onetime local high school sports star, died in the burn unit at a Syracuse, New York, hospital in December.

A number of public health experts agree with Silver’s assessment. They argue that professional athletes — who are younger, healthier and have significantly higher vaccination rates than the general public — don’t face enough risk from the virus to warrant aggressive mitigation rules that could end up suspending play entirely.", "Several players and coaches have even made the case that the leagues are still being overly cautious, particularly when it comes to vaccinated players with mild or asymptomatic COVID cases. “If you’re asymptomatic, you should be allowed to play,” Tampa Bay Buccaneers coach ", " told reporters earlier this month. The only way to live with COVID in the long term, some pundits argue, is to accept low-risk cases as a part of everyday life.", "But critics have accused the leagues of putting profits over safety by creating policies designed to limit disruptions caused by COVID cases, rather than by preventing the cases in the first place. They argue that the only responsible approach is to ramp up testing and mitigation procedures, even if that means more players have to sit out or more games are canceled. Others make the point that, though the players themselves may face little risk, they can still serve as vectors and transmit the virus to vulnerable people in the cities they live and travel to.

Instead of clinging to a false sense of security, a return to vigilance is the league’s best hope to protect its players, coaches and to again deliver an uninterrupted season.” — Mike Jones, ", "“[The NBA’s] shutdown in March 2020 seemed overkill at the time and still does—why couldn’t the league have kept playing and broadcasting games from empty arenas? But its action was a social and political landmark. … With so much credibility in the bank, the NBA could play a similar role today, this time signaling the end of magical thinking about Covid by joining the NFL in saying that players who are healthy can play.” — Holman W. Jenkins, Jr., ", "“Professional sports leagues — the NBA in particular — are already hemorrhaging money due to lower attendance attributed to the public’s concern about Covid. Shutting down games altogether would be an economic disaster. That doesn’t mean they shouldn’t shut down, just that they won’t.” — Dave Zirin, ", "“There are few areas of life, if any, where the people involved have a higher vaccination rate and are at lower risk from the coronavirus. We have seen 21 months of cancellations and postponements, nearly a year of them occurring after the vaccine had become readily available. … Sports leagues should end the charade, because most people by now see it for the performative panic that it is.” — Zachary Faria, ", "“As far as we know, none of these players have anything remotely close to life-threatening infections, and plenty are asymptomatic. … The lesson is that widespread vaccination has achieved what some of the Covid-19 skeptics were asserting back in March 2020 — it turned SARS-CoV-2 into something comparable to a bad winter flu season. It’s a pain, but it’s not the sort of menace we shut down society to stop.” — Jim Geraghty, ", "“When community transmission's high, and you have a novel variant, this is a time to be more cautious. Both to protect the players, but also to set the right tone and send the right message about what we need to be prioritizing as a society right now.” — Kathleen Bachynski, infectious disease specialist, to ", "“As the world of professional sport contemplates its next move through lists of postponements and cancellations … it is imperative that sport remains a team player in society, demonstrating the kind of sportsmanship that ensures not just the safety of its players, but also for the communities in which they play.” — Amy Bass, ", "“There’s going to be a time where we want the NFL to demonstrate there’s a future ahead of us. That we can start taking a different road.
